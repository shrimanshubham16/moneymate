# 🌿 FinFlow v2.0 - Privacy & Security Update

## 🔐 Your Data, Your Control

We've upgraded FinFlow with **end-to-end encryption** to give you complete privacy over your financial data.

## What This Means For You

### 🛡️ Your Sensitive Data is Encrypted

All your financial information is now encrypted **on your device** before it ever leaves your phone:

- ✅ Income sources & amounts
- ✅ Expense names & amounts  
- ✅ Investment details
- ✅ Credit card information
- ✅ Loan details

**Only you can see your data.** Not even FinFlow's servers can read it.

### 🔑 Your 24-Word Recovery Key

When you sign up, you'll receive a **24-word recovery key**. This is your master key to your encrypted data.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:**
- Write it down on paper and store it safely
- This key is the **only way** to recover your data if you forget your password
- We cannot recover your data without this key
- Never share it with anyone

---

### 📧 Email Verification

We now ask for your email address during signup (optional but recommended):

- **Account recovery** - Reset your password if you forget it
- **Security alerts** - Get notified of important account activity
- **Your email is never shared** with third parties

---

### 🔄 Password Reset Made Safe

If you forget your password:

1. Request a reset code via email
2. Enter your 24-word recovery key
3. Create a new password

Your data stays encrypted throughout - we never see it.

## Questions?

**Q: What if I lose my recovery key AND forget my password?**
A: Unfortunately, your data cannot be recovered. This is the trade-off for true privacy.

**Q: Can FinFlow see my financial data?**
A: No. Your data is encrypted on your device. We only see encrypted text that's meaningless without your password.

**Q: Is my data backed up?**
A: Yes, encrypted backups are stored securely. Only you can decrypt them.

**Q: What happens to my existing data?**
A: Existing users keep their data. New users get automatic encryption.
