1/ 🚀 FinFlow v1.2 is LIVE!

After months of building, I'm excited to share FinFlow with you.

It's a simple, free tool that shows your financial health in one number.

No complexity. No subscriptions. Just clarity.

👉 https://freefinflow.vercel.app/

2/ What makes FinFlow different?

Most finance apps track what you spent.
FinFlow shows what you'll have LEFT.

It's not about the past.
It's about your future financial health.

3/ Here's how it works:

✅ Add your income sources
✅ Add your expenses (fixed & variable)
✅ Add your investments
✅ Get your financial health score

One number. Clear. Simple.

4/ Why I built it:

I was tired of:
- Complicated budgeting apps
- Endless spreadsheets
- Apps that cost money
- Tools that overwhelm

I wanted ONE number that tells me: "Am I going to be okay this month?"

5/ What you get:

✨ Free forever (no catch)
🔒 Your privacy (same level as Mint/YNAB)
📱 Works everywhere (mobile, tablet, desktop)
⚡ Real-time updates
🎨 Beautiful, simple UI

6/ Perfect for:

- People tired of complex apps
- Anyone who wants clarity
- Those who value free tools
- Users who want simplicity

Try it: https://freefinflow.vercel.app/

Would love your feedback! 🙏
