## Longer Version (Blog/Post)

**FinFlow v1.2 is Now Live**

After months of building and testing, FinFlow is finally available for everyone.

**What is FinFlow?**
A simple, free tool that shows you your financial health in one number. Add your income, expenses, and investments, and instantly see what you'll have left at month-end.

**Why I Built It**
I was tired of complicated budgeting apps and endless spreadsheets. I wanted something that just tells me: "Am I going to be okay this month?" So I built it.

**What Makes It Different**
- **One Number**: Your financial health score - clear, actionable, simple
- **Future-Focused**: Not about what you spent, but what you'll have left
- **Free Forever**: No subscriptions, no ads, no hidden costs
- **Your Privacy**: Your data stays yours. Same privacy level as Mint & YNAB
- **Works Everywhere**: Mobile, tablet, desktop - pick your device

**Who It's For**
- People who want simplicity over complexity
- Anyone tired of spreadsheets
- Those who value free, no-strings-attached tools
- Users who want clarity on their finances

**Try It Free**
No signup required to explore. No credit card. No catch.

**Feedback Welcome**
This is v1.2, and I'm constantly improving it. If you try it and have feedback, I'd love to hear it.
