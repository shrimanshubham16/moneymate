## For Reddit (r/personalfinance, r/India)

**Title:** I built a free app to track financial health - no ads, no subscriptions

**Body:**
Hey everyone!

I built FinFlow because I was frustrated with existing finance apps - too complex, too expensive, or too cluttered.

**What it does:**
Shows your financial health in one number. Add income, expenses, investments. See what you'll have left at month-end.

**Why it's different:**
- Focuses on future financial health, not just past spending
- One number that tells you everything
- Free forever - no ads, no subscriptions
- Your data stays private

**Try it:** https://freefinflow.vercel.app/

Would love your feedback!

✅ **Future** - What you'll have, not what you spent  
✅ **Private** - Your data stays yours  
✅ **Authentic** - Be real, not salesy
