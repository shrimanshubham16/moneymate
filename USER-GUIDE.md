## 📊 Understanding Calculations

### Health Score Formula

```
Available Funds = Total Income - Payments Made So Far

Unpaid Obligations = Unpaid Fixed + Planned Variable + 
                     Unpaid Investments + Unpaid Credit Cards

Health Score = Available Funds - Unpaid Obligations
```

### Monthly Cycle

- **Start**: Your billing cycle start day
- **End**: Day before next cycle
- **Reset**: All dues reset on new cycle
