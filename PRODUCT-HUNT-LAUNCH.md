FinFlow helps you understand your financial health at a glance. Add your income, expenses, and investments, and get a real-time health score that tells you exactly what you'll have left at month-end.

🎯 **One Number**
Your financial health score - simple, clear, actionable. Not about what you spent. About what you'll have left.

💰 **Free Forever**
No subscriptions. No ads. No hidden costs. Just works.

🔒 **Your Privacy**
Your data stays yours. Same privacy level as Mint & YNAB.

📱 **Works Everywhere**
Mobile, tablet, desktop - all your devices.

⚡ **Real-Time**
See your financial health update as you add expenses.

🎨 **Beautiful UI**
Clean, modern interface that doesn't overwhelm.

**Perfect For:**
- People tired of complex budgeting apps
- Anyone who wants clarity on their finances
- Those who value simplicity over features
- Users who want free, no-strings-attached tools

**What Makes It Different:**
While other apps focus on tracking past expenses, FinFlow shows you your future financial health. It's not about what you spent - it's about what you'll have left.

### Maker Comment (Post after launch)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I built FinFlow because I was tired of complicated finance apps and endless spreadsheets.

**The Problem:**
Existing finance apps were either too complex, too expensive, or too cluttered. I wanted clarity without complexity.

**The Solution:**
FinFlow shows your financial health in one number - what you'll have left at month-end. It's not about tracking past spending. It's about understanding your future financial health.

**Why Free:**
I built this for myself first. If it helps others, that's a bonus. No plans to monetize. Just want to help people get clarity on their finances.

**What's Next:**
This is v1.2. I'm constantly improving based on user feedback. Upcoming features:
- Server-side encryption (v1.3)
- Mobile app (v2.0)
- Sharing features (v2.0)

**Feedback Welcome:**
Try it and let me know what you think! What features would make it better?

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏
