## Option 1: Casual & Personal (Recommended)

```
Hey! 👋

I've been working on a personal finance app called FinFlow and just launched it. Thought you might find it useful.

It shows your financial health in one number - what you'll have left at month-end after all bills and expenses.

I built it for myself because I was tired of complicated apps and spreadsheets. Wanted something simple that just tells me: "Am I going to be okay this month?"

It's:
- Free (no catch, no ads)
- Simple (no learning curve)
- Private (your data stays yours)
- Works on phone and computer

If you get a chance, check it out: https://freefinflow.vercel.app/

No pressure at all - just thought I'd share since you might find it useful! 😊

Let me know what you think if you try it!

Hi everyone! 👋

I've been working on something and just launched it - FinFlow, a free financial health tracker.

It's basically a simple way to know if you'll have enough money at the end of the month. Add your income, expenses, investments - get one number that tells you everything.

I built it for myself, but thought you might find it useful too.

It's completely free, no ads, and your data stays private.

If you want to check it out: https://freefinflow.vercel.app/

No pressure - just sharing in case it helps! 😊

Let me know what you think!

## Tips for WhatsApp

✅ **Do:**
- Keep it personal and casual
- Mention you built it for yourself
- No pressure - "if you want"
- Ask for feedback
- Keep it short (WhatsApp is for quick messages)

❌ **Don't:**
- Sound too salesy
- Use too many emojis
- Make it too long
- Pressure them to try it
- Sound like marketing copy

---

## When to Send

- **Morning (9-11 AM)** - Best engagement
- **Evening (6-8 PM)** - Good for casual messages
- **Avoid:** Late night, early morning, work hours

---

## Follow-Up (If They Try It)

## If They Ask Questions

**"Is it really free?"**
"Yeah, completely free. No catch. I built it for myself, so if it helps others, that's a bonus."

**"How does it work?"**
"Super simple - add income, expenses, investments. Get one number that shows what you'll have left at month-end. Takes 5 minutes to set up."

**"Is my data safe?"**
"Yep! Same privacy level as Mint/YNAB. Your data stays yours. I can't see your finances even if I wanted to (which I don't)."

**"Why did you build it?"**
"I was tired of complicated apps and spreadsheets. Wanted one number that tells me if I'm going to be okay. So I built it."

**Pick the one that matches your relationship with them!** 😊
