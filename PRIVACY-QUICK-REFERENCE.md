# 🔒 Privacy Quick Reference - For User Conversations

## 🎯 The One-Minute Answer

**"Can you see my finances?"**

> "Technically, I can access the data file on the server, but I don't. This is the same privacy level as Mint, YNAB, and Personal Capital - trusted financial apps that millions use. Your password is hashed (I can't see it), your data is isolated per user, and all connections are encrypted. We're adding server-side encryption in v1.3 and end-to-end encryption option in v2.0."

## 💬 Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "How do I know you're not looking at my data?"

**A:**
> "I understand your concern. Here's the truth:
> - I have no reason to look at your personal finances
> - This is how most financial apps work (Mint, YNAB, etc.)
> - Your data is isolated - I'd have to specifically access your user ID
> - We're adding encryption in future updates
> - You can export your data anytime and delete your account if you're not comfortable"

### Q: "What if you get hacked?"

**A:**
> "Good question. Currently:
> - Passwords are hashed (hackers can't get your password)
> - Data is isolated per user
> - We're adding server-side encryption in v1.3 to make stolen data useless
> - End-to-end encryption in v2.0 will make it impossible to read even if hacked"

### Q: "I want maximum privacy"

**A:**
> "We understand. We're planning:
> - Server-side encryption in v1.3 (makes data useless if stolen)
> - End-to-end encryption option in v2.0 (even we can't read your data)
> - Note: E2EE means no password recovery (you lose password = data lost)
> - You can also run the app locally for complete control"
